## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Musaveershaik/React-Native-App.git
   cd React-Native-App
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the App**

   Run the app with:

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

   You can choose to open the app on:
   - **Android Emulator**
   - **iOS Simulator**
   - **Expo Go** (for testing on physical devices)

## Project Structure

Edit files within the **app** directory to add features. This project uses file-based routing.

### Reset the Project

If you want a fresh start, use:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This moves starter code to **app-example** and creates a new blank **app** folder.

## Notes

**AppWrite** is used for backend services, including user authentication and data storage.
